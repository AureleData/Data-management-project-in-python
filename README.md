Data management project using Python


## Overview

I played a crucial role in a larger project involving the migration and organization of data from an outdated statistical management system to a new statistical software system. While others handled data extraction and adjustments, my focus was on the reorganization of the data using Python.

## Objectives

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Colleagues extracted data from the outdated statistical management system.

2. **Data Adjustments:**
   - Another team implemented necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility with the new system.

3. **Data Reorganization (My Contribution in this github page):**
   - Utilized Excel to reorganize and structure the data for seamless integration into the new statistical software system (All the data have been modified for security reasons as they are confidentials).

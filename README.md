# Data-management-project
Data management project using Python


## Overview

I played a crucial role in a larger project involving the migration and organization of data from an outdated statistical management system to a new statistical software system. While others handled data extraction and adjustments, my focus was on the reorganization of the data using Python.

## Objectives

1. **Data Extraction:**
   - Colleagues extracted data from the outdated statistical management system.

2. **Data Adjustments:**
   - Another team implemented necessary adjustments to ensure compatibility with the new system.

3. **Data Reorganization (My Contribution in this github page):**
   - Utilized Excel to reorganize and structure the data for seamless integration into the new statistical software system (All the data have been modified for security reasons as they are confidentials).
## Approach and Implementation Details

The primary goal of my involvement was to guarantee the consistency between the data in the new data allocation file and the output file, ensuring that the information aligns with the input data while incorporating country and economic sector allocation.

### Key Steps Taken:

1. **Cubes vs. Rcode:**
   - Within the new system, we adopted a cube-based approach for categorizing services, replacing the outdated Rcode typology. My task involved mapping Rcode references to their corresponding cube identifiers, ensuring seamless transition and alignment with historical data.

2. **Country Allocation:**
   - Leveraging the Rcode information, I extracted country allocations to maintain alignment with past data records, ensuring accuracy and continuity.

3. **Sector Allocation (Cube Alloc Sheet):**
   - The cube allocation sheet played a pivotal role in ensuring alignment with historical data in terms of sector allocation within the Maltese economy. By meticulously updating and validating this information, we maintained data integrity throughout the migration process.

## Conclusion

Through careful data reorganization and alignment efforts, we successfully facilitated the transition to the new statistical software system while preserving data consistency and integrity. The methodologies and practices showcased here reflect a commitment to excellence in data management within a dynamic and evolving environment.
